I\'m signing up for Raplit's 100 days of Python
challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding
along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do 
this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses
for not coding from the middle of a field or the wilderness!
I am feeling 💪😍😃🥳
Feel free to follow my progress at replit.com/@richardsonrowen """)
