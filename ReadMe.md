# 100 Days of Code - README

Welcome my 100 Days of Coding - Python repository! This document outlines the progress and activities completed from Day 1 to Day 100.

## Day 1 - Welcome to Python 🐍

- I've learned the python basics of print statments and functions 
- Created a main.py file with correct syntax, how to print on terminal
- The correct way to print multiple string texts and use Emoji's in python 🥳


##  Day 2 - Input and Variablise 👥

- Learned more about the input function why we use it and its purpose.
- Variables and how variables store states or information of what was input in the terminal.
- Did a fun and quick getting to know you challenge.
- Still printing everything out line by line and on Day 3 we shall clean it up

## Day 3 - Concatinating ➕

- How to concatenate. I learned what concatenting is.
- Built a funny weird menu project 
- Created print statments that has both a string and a variable in it.

<h3>The following highlighted text should take you to Replit so you can try out my weird menu project</h3>

    <h4>instructions for the project:</h4>

        - Click on the top green button that says RUN
        - You should see a new window on the right side with the texted called Console
        - Under the Console, you will see the output of the program
        - You can click on the end of the question text and start typing.

Happy Coding! and thank you for trying the weired menu. 

## Day 4 - Print in Colour 🖨️📚

- I'm writing my own adventure story and making the project POP with some color!
- learned about using \033[1;31m for red text and \033[1;32m for green text
- I also learned about the use of \033[0m to reset the color back to normal

        The below text is the colour grading of the adventure story or the coloures used.

            Color	Value
            Default	0
            Black	30
            Red	31
            Green	32
            Yellow	33
            Blue	34
            Purple	35
            Cyan	36
            White	37

## Day 5 - What the Elif (If and Else Statments) pt.1 🧝🏽

- Else and If statments and how to use them with conditions 
- Learned proper indentation and syntax error how they occur and what to look out for.
- Built my very first Akinator 🧞‍♂️ style game with 'if' statements

## Day 6 - What the Elif pt.2 🧝🏽

- Learned about the elif statment
- Did a bit more creating more like a mini login form where users are asked about they username or name and password.

## Day 7 - The Nesting Doll / Code 🪆

- Learned about nesting code and how code is nested in itself
- learned how to properly fix nesting code and endintations
- built a true fan detector like a mini detictive to see if people truly like a show

## Day 8 - Good Vibes Affirmation Generator 😎

- This day was all about putting everything I've learned from day one till today into one project.
- It was a great review; I used everything from variables, inputs, if/elif/else, and even colored text.
- Built a cool affirmation generator to send out some good vibes!

## Day 9 - Casting 🔄

- This day was all about understanding data types and how to convert between them.
- Learned the importance of casting to ensure variables are in the correct format for calculations or comparisons.
- Practiced casting with integers, floats, and strings to see how they interact.
- Built small snippets to convert user input into the right data type for different scenarios.

It was a day of making sure my data types are in the right shape to work with, and I now feel more confident handling different kinds of data in Python!

## Day 10 - Show me the money 💰

- Learned about mathamatical functions and they operators 
- it was all about math today so Used the following math symbols 

        *The following Math Symbols where used*

        + - Addition
        - - Subtraction
        * - Multiplication
        / - Division
        % - Modulo gives us the remainder of the division
        ** - Squared this gives us the square root also known as the exponent
        // - Divisor this divided whole numbers or divides whole numbers

        *We also need to take note of the fact that the equals sign (=) is used to assign values to 
        variables and can not be used as a part of an expression. That's why we use the print 
        statment to give us the calculated answer.*

- Built my own tip calculator! 
    - the calculator functions as follows:

        We ask users the total bill amount
        Then the total number of users splitting the bill if any
        Once they've answered the to questions we ask them how much they want to tip

        And when thats all done the calculator does the following:

        It first takes the tip divides it by 100 then multiplies it by the bill.
        after that the answer is returned by rounding off by 2 decimal places once the 
        bill and the final tip amount has been added. 

        example:

            totalBill = round(bill + tip, 2)
            prints(totalBill)

## Day 11 - 525,600 Min ⏱️
- Did my first own real challenge. Building a simple year to min calculator
- Research has been done on my end using google as a resourse to remind myself how years to min are calculated
- used everything I've learned from day one till now to get this far.

## Day 12 - Its all about the bugs 🚫🪲
- Did some debugging
- used my experince to solve the bugs
- learned that the console or the terminal can be used a source to find and debug quickly

## Day 13 - Whats your grade 🅰️➕
- Had to use all the skilles learned from Day 1 till now
- Building the app was fun and it tested my abilities to self code 
- I feel comfortable coding by myself now it seems fun and interesting 

## Day 14 - Lets play a game of 🪨📰✂️
- Today is all about playing Rock, paper scissors
- Focusing on nesting statments
- Built a two player rock paper scissors game where each players answers are hidden.

## Day 15 - What's a while 🔁
- Learned about while loops 
- I've also learned that if you don't have two conditions to nest a statment you can yous the [else] statment to do so 
- built a little while loop or game asking users to choose an animal from a list of 4 animals to get a sound out 

    <h4>Heres what I learned or built visually</h4>

    -   exit = ""

        while exit != "yes":
            animal = input("What animal would you like to hear? ")
            if animal == "cow":
                print("Well a Cow goes Mooo.")
            else:
                if animal == "dog":
                    print("A dog goes woof woof.")
                elif animal == "cat":
                    print("Do cats even make a sound? I guess cats go meaow")
                elif animal == "lesser spotted lemur":
                    print("This is a funny one cause the Lesser Spotted Lemur goes awooga")
                else:
                    print("That's not an animal silly")
            exit = input("Would you like to EXIT?: ")

## Day 16 - What the infinit loop ➿
- how to end or stop loops using the break method 
- created a mini games

## Day 17 - Lets break and exit from loops 🔁➿
- learned how to break a loop and exit from one
- updated my rock paper sciorss game
- had a chanllenge but fix it and figured out here I went wrong 
    - which was not properly calling the score counters and objects
    - and not being able to aquratily keep they score up to date
