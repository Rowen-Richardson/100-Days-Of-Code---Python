Welcome my 100 Days of Coding - Python repository! This document outlines the progress and activities completed from Day 1 to Day 100.

## Day 1 - Welcome to Python 

- I've learned the python basics of print statments and functions 
- Created a main.py file with correct syntax, how to print on terminal

    <h4>instructions for the project:</h4>

        - Click on the top green button that says RUN
        - You should see a new window on the right side with the texted called Console
        - Under the Console, you will see the output of the program
        - You can click on the end of the question text and start typing.

Happy Coding! and thank you for trying the weired menu. 

## Day 4 - Print in Colour

- I'm writing my own adventure story and making the project POP with some color!
- learned about using \033[1;31m for red text and \033[1;32m for green text
- I also learned about the use of \033[0m to reset the color back to normal

        The below text is the colour grading of the adventure story or the coloures used.

            Color	Value
            Default	0
            Black	30
            Red	31

            Purple	35
            Cyan	36
            White	37
